After years of **procrastination,** I've finally decided to give a chance to this simple space (based on [Hugo][1]), and just focus on writing contents.

I will try to force the **nerd side of me** not to waste time on **techy stuff**, which is **most of the time** the way to **mark the bitter destiny** of personal **side projects**.

**Writing is hard** - it requires _focus, skills, and time_; ideas are unshaped, and training and patience are needed to transform them into understandable and compelling words.

**We developers** tend to automate all the boring stuff and focus on business logic; that's why I am **experimenting** with **some tools** and **services** to make the **writing experience less painful**; maybe I'll write something on this subject in the future.

**Writing for me** is one of the **hardest things I've ever done _(_**_well, I tried to do it several times, miserably failing all the times)._

I **always tried to avoid it** by sharing ideas in other expressive forms, mainly using myself as a medium (talks, videos, podcasts, etc.). Still, I always felt that a **good storyteller** must also be **capable of writing** without fear, whether writing about a small tech article or something more articulated;

As with everything else, **study and practice will do the rest**; I'll put my time on the table again; let's see if things will be better this time.

The idea, for now, is to invest **8 hours monthly** just to write here. Will it be enough? **We'll see**.

I'll write about **Kubernetes**, **Linux**, **development, programming languages**, and other random stuff that will capture my attention, so stay tuned and subscribe to the [RSS feed.][3]
