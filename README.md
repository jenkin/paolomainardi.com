Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog; I'm releasing the source code publicly, so you can see how it is made under the hood.

The articles are released under the [CC-BY-NC-CD](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license.

The project is quite simple; it uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.it) and the lovely [
Hugo coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme.

If you want to contact me, drop me a message on the contacts you can find [here](https://www.paolomainardi.com/about/).
